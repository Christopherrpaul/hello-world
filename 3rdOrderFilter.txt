;R_series	In 1952 the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) decided to define the resistance
;				and tolerance values into a norm, to ease the mass manufacturing of resistors. 
;				These are referred to as preferred values or E-series, and they are published in standard 
;				IEC 60063:1963. The standard values also apply to capacitors. An example is E-12. 
;				Here, component values are separated approximately by a factor of 10^(1/12). 
;				Common series are E-6, E-12, E-24, E-48, E-96 and E-192. Higher number series have better
;				component tolerances and offer better resolution in finding the best overall component 
;				value solutions. These allow the program to find filter solutions with lower
;				sensitivities and which more accurately represent the specified poles.

;Rg			the value the program will use for rg. Since only the ratio rf/rg (not the value of rg) matters
;				to filter sensitivities, the program will vary only rf and keep rg fixed.

;Rf_min	 	the smallest non-zero value resistance that the program will consider for rf. 
;				(It will consider a value of zero.) It is suggested that this be no more than Rg/100.

;Rf_max	 	the largest value resistance that the program will consider for rf. 
;				It is recommended that this be rg, which should offer an equal value capacitor solution.
;				Such solutions have relatively poor sensitivities in 2nd order filter designs,
;				as do solutions with even larger ratios of rf/rg. The same is generally true in 3rd oder filers.
